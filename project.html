                    Movie Booking System: Java Console Application<br>
                <time datetime="2021-11">November 2021</time>
                </h2>
                <p>During my Software Development 1 module, I developed a Java-based movie booking system. The project allowed users to book seats for a movie, with real-time seat availability notifications. If a seat was already booked, the system would immediately notify the user, ensuring no double bookings.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The application featured a payment option, enabling users to pay for their tickets after selecting a movie. Upon successful payment, the system would print a ticket with all necessary details. I also implemented validation checks throughout the process, ensuring a smooth user experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This project was entirely console-based but demonstrated key principles of seat management, user interaction, and transaction handling. Although simple, it functioned well and marked an important step in my journey as a software developer.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>In the Mathematics for Computing module, I gained valuable knowledge in foundational concepts like logic gates and IP addressing. This course emphasized problem-solving skills, with a focus on understanding how logic gates function to perform calculations and operations in digital circuits. We also explored IP addresses, learning how to calculate and assign them efficiently within network structures.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This module sharpened my analytical abilities and deepened my understanding of how mathematical principles are applied in computing.</p>

                    Software Development II (November 2022): Java OOP Coursework and Career Impact<br>
                </h2>
                <p>In the Software Development II coursework, I developed key skills that are crucial for a successful career in technology. I mastered advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, which enabled me to create scalable systems. Additionally, I tackled synchronization issues in concurrency and multi-threading, enhancing my performance optimization skills. I applied the producer-consumer pattern, which significantly improved my resource management abilities.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>On the technical side, I gained practical experience with JavaFX for building user-friendly front-end interfaces and developed server-side logic in Java, preparing me for full-stack development roles.</p><br>
                <p>This coursework also had a substantial impact on my career prospects. It enhanced my portfolio by showcasing my technical skills through a complex project, and it provided concrete examples for interviews, especially in discussing challenges like deadlocks. Furthermore, I improved my communication and time management skills, which are essential for thriving in professional environments.
                </p>
